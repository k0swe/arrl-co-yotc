# ARRL Colorado Section's Year of the Club

In 2026, the [American Radio Relay League](https://www.arrl.org/) is celebrating the
[Year of the Club](https://www.arrl.org/year-of-the-club)! The Colorado Section is participating by
organizing and advertising our clubs' events and activities throughout the year. This tool will help
clubs in the Colorado Section plan and promote their events for the Year of the Club.

## Primary Use Cases

This app exists to serve these use cases:

* Let amateur radio clubs publish events.
* Let club operators express interest in operating for the events.
* Let the public know when these club events are happening.
* Let event operators upload their QSO logs after the event.
* Track contest standings.

To enable these use cases, there are a number of ancilliary flows related to registering users, creating clubs, associating users to clubs, and other administrative tasks.
